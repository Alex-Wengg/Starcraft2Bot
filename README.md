# basicSc2TerranBot
So this Terran bot can harvest minerals and vespene gas and build up a small army of marauders and medivacs send to attack the enemy base. It is incomplete because my Mac is too slow at processing the game when it reaches the 7 minutes mark but overall it is still a decent bot. It can call down mules, build marauders, expand, deal ok with harasses and has a 1/5 chance of a barrack not being to build a techlab. Future edits will continue as of 14/01/2019
