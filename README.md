                          Abilities:
Abstraction: A Python created AI bot designed to defeat Hard level diffculty bots. The bot is designed to react to enemy attacks until sufficient fighting force has been build up. The economy and resources harvested has been demonstrated to handle constant unit production and to finish all the demanded upgrades/researches. The mineral to gas ratio is well met to produce the desired army units with always over 1000 mineral and gas after each game. The result is constant supply block after passing 75 population due to nonstop productions. Enemy assaults have been well repelled with minimal casualities and offensives to the enemy bases being very successful. 

Improvements: The lack of individual unit management is to be improved, units will continue to attack despite low health and lack of support. Units do not know how to retreat from a loss battle and will fight to the end. 

Medicvacs have been a great problem to the program as their general intelligence greatly hinders their efficiency, most of the time has been spend increasing the intelligence with limited success. The medics are much slower to be sent to the front line due their diffcult to program targets to heal and save. 

The addons cannot be build at times because of their invalided locations but this is a rare occurance.
Future: These improvements and innovations will be made in the foreseeable future until new ideas and abstractions can be found or interests into the game has returned.

The list below are the properties or abilities of the program.

-Researches, 

  -ENGINEERING BAY:INFANTRY WEAPON LEVEL 1
  
  -BARRACKS TECHLAB: STIMPACK, CONCUSSIVE SHELL, COMBATSHIELD
  
-Unit Production,

  -BARRACKS REACTOR: MARINE(2 at a time per barrack reactor)
  
  -BARRACKS TECHLAB: MARAUDER
  
  -STARPORT: MEDICVAC
  
  -COMMANDCENTER | ORBITALCOMMAND : SCV
  
-Unit Ability:

  -MARINE | MARAUDER: use STIMPACKS when enemies in radius of 10
  
  -ORBTIALCOMMAND: CALLDOWN MULE when sufficient energy availible
  
-Unit Efficiency

  SCV(workers): {able to gather minerals with rare oversaturation,
  
   increase supply limits when necessary(usually after the 80 population range,
   automatically build the next structure when requirements are met}
                 
  MARINE|MARAUDER: {can handle enemy scouts and skirmishes quite well,
                 
  in most iterations, the marauders soak the enemy attacks}
                 
  MEDICVAC: {great diffculty to command and automate due its weird mechanics,
  
  takes time to be properly brought to the frontline to heal units,
  
  ai intelligences requires great improvement,
  
  overall still effective enough to improve army unit lives}
  
  GHOST(untested, diffcult to test):{designed to calldown nukes onto enemy mineral lines,
  
  snipe dangerous and powerful enemy ZERG units such as VIPERS, INFESTORS, BROODLORD and ULTRALISK,
                  
  emp made to null or weaken enemy PROTOSS spellcasters such as HIGHTEMPLARS, COLLOSSI, MOTHERSHIP, SENTRY}
                  
  REAPER(untest will impend in future):{designed to scout for unusually enemy structure placement and plans,
  
  harass worker units}
